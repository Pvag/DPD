# Week 1

Welcome to week 1 of our 
[*"Defensive programming and debugging"*](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/defensive-programming-and-debugging) MOOC.

For this week, you will need some source code to complete the quizzes.
Although you can simply copy/paste them from FutureLearn, they are
available here as well, since this may be more convenient.

You will find the code for the C track and the Fortran track in the
respective directories.

**Note:** this code will be used during multiple weeks as running
examples.  It contains bugs, but you don't need to fix them now, that
is for one of the next weeks.

So yes, it is intentionally buggy, but well, this MOOC is about
debugging after all.
